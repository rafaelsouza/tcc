\section{Conclusion}

My conclusion is that SL is a learning theory that supports motivation as
described in the SDL in a very satisfactory manner. Because both SDT and SL have
a very compreheensive body of evidence supporting them, this connection only
increases their strenght.

I view this as another call for the people who are responsible for educational
institutions to reflect on their assumptions and purposes because the
problem of unmotivated students is the fault of our institutions, and not of the
students.\cite{education:joseph_phyllis__pbl}
