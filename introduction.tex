\section{Introduction}

The problem I will address in this article is the lack of a specific motivation
theory for project based learning and the minor number of academic works linking
self-determination theory(SDT) to educational settings.

I will approach the problem by demonstrating the foundations used by SDT and I
will show how the situative learning(SL) approach relates satisfactory to these
foundations. 

Summarizing, I intend to contribute the following in this article:

\begin{itemize}
 
    \item I will describe both SDT and SL in a concise and
    straightforward manner, drawing parallels between the two models.

    \item I will describe how SL is a model that fosters the
    principles of SDT.

\end{itemize}
